//This one wasn't serious at all, very very easy. Although I was trying to find the shortest way to write false without writing false, so it took more
// longer than I'm willing to admit, but I think I got the shortest answer
//After looking at other people's answers it seems mine wasn't the shorted. "return !1" was shorter :(

//It's a well known fact that anything Chuck Norris wants, he gets. As a result Chuck very rarely has to use the word false.
//It is a less well known fact that if something is true, and Chuck doesn't want it to be, Chuck can scare the truth with his massive biceps, and it automatically becomes false.
//Your task is to be more like Chuck (ha! good luck!). You must return false without ever actually using the word false...
//Go show some truth who's boss!

function ifChuckSaysSo(){
    // 1 === 0 evaluates to false, so false is returned
    return !true;
  }

console.log(ifChuckSaysSo());
